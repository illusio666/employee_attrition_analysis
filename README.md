## Employee Attrition Analysis

The following analysis looks at a total of 1400 employee records, some of whom have left the organisation. The intent is to improve our understanding of those departing employees, understand if there might be any common factors causing their departure, and to be able to predict future potential departures. This will allow the organisation to do two things:
- to address any underlying factors that have a significant relationship to employee departure, and
- identify those employees at highest risk of departure and focus on their retention as a priority.

## Project Objective üìä

The business has asked that the Data Analysis team review the data and identify actions that management may consider to improve staff retention. These recommendations should be clear and supported with easily-understood charts and visualisations for those team members who are not data analysts.

## Dataset Content & Overview üìÅ

This publicly-available  data set has been sourced from HuggingFace <https://huggingface.co/datasets/Redsmoothy/HR_Attrition>

## Hypotheses and validation approach 

There are 4 hypotheses that the business has asked to be validated as part of this analysis:

1) Attrition is spread evenly across all departments, with no single department having a statistically-significant higher attrition.
2) Employees living further away from work are more inclined to leave, as commute times are a factor in work:life balance
3) Younger employees are more likely to be 'job hoppers' and so hiring and retention needs to consider how this may be mitigated
4) Job stagnation (years in the same role) causes attrition

These four hypotheses will be tested, to allow the business to develop actions plans to address any root causes.

Additionally, the data will be analysed to see if any other correlations can be found between employee attrition and other factors, either individually or combined, to allow the business to determine if there are other actions that may be beneficial.

Employees will then be clustered based on their risk profile to allow the business to tailor their retention approaches.

## Hypothesis 1 - No department has greater attrition than the others

## Hypothesis 2 - Commute distance has an impact on retention

## Hypothesis 3 - Younger employees are more likely to leave (CARE: how do you baseline this? Your older workers were once young and if they haven't job-hopped, this doesn't hold water)

## Hypothesis 4 - Job stagnation leads to attrition
